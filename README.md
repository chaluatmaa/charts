# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/chaluatmaa/charts.git`
### `cd charts`
### `npm i`
### `npm start`

 # `We are using react-charts-2 for the task since it's light weight and animated by default which also saves extra work of animation and avoids bloating of the app. react-charts-2 is the react wrapper of light-weight JS Library Charts.js`

### The data is taken in two parts , `labels` and `datasets`
### labels for labelling the graphs
### datasets , to take objects or array of objects for plotting the graph
### datasets array of objects have two mandatory keys "label" and "data"
### `labels` takes the array of `strings`
### `label` in the `datasets` takes the `string` as heading and `data` in `datasets` takes the array of `constants` for plotting.
